Switches
====

Some models of switches. Neat if you want to see how a switch looks in your keyboard when you are modeling it.

Remember that the measurements are not *exact*. They are a "best effort" to reproduce how the things looks. Using a caliper and going by eye for all the measurements so things can be off. Hopefully not too much.


# Goal
Basically to just model different kinds of switches I get a hold of. I've found that it is sooo much easier to design a keyboard when you can import switches and keycaps to see how much space you actually need for things.
